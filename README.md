# Here are the general steps that I have taken to create a simple morse code genenrator. The steps mentioned here are also available in the source code, so you can easily compare the code with the steps taken to make it.


# Import the necessary modules:

# Import the tkinter module as tk to create the GUI.
# Create the Morse code dictionary:

# Define a dictionary called morse_code that maps each English character to its corresponding Morse code representation.
# Define the conversion function:

# Create 2 functions, such as convert_to_morse() and convert_to_english(), which retrieves the text entered by the user, iterates through each character, looks up its Morse code value in the dictionary, and builds the Morse code string.
# Update a label or output field to display the Morse code text.
# Create the main window:

# Use tk.Tk() to create the main window for the GUI application.
# Set the window title using window.title().
# Create the input entry field:

# Use tk.Entry() to create an input field where the user can enter English text.
# Adjust the width of the entry field using the width parameter.
# Use .grid() to place the entry field in the window layout.
# Create the "Convert" button:

# Use tk.Button() to create 2 buttons labeled "To Morse" and "To English".
# Set the command parameter to the name of the corresponding conversion function (e.g., command=convert_to_morse and command=convert_to_english).
# Use .grid() to place the button in the window layout.
# Create the output label:

# Use tk.Label() to create a label for displaying the Morse code output.
# Set the initial text of the label to an empty string or a default value.
# Set the font and any desired formatting options.
# Use .grid() to place the label in the window layout.
# Start the GUI loop:

# Use window.mainloop() to start the main loop of the GUI application.
# This loop will handle events and keep the application running until the window is closed.
